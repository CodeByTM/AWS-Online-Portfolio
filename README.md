# ☁️ AWS Cloud Resume Challenge

This project is part of the **AWS Cloud Resume Challenge**, a hands-on cloud engineering project that demonstrates skills in web development, AWS services, and DevOps automation.

---

## 🧭 Overview

The goal of this project is to build and deploy a **personal resume website** entirely in the AWS Cloud — complete with a live visitor counter, serverless backend, and automated deployment pipelines.

At the moment, the **frontend portion (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript)** is complete and running locally.  
The next steps involve deploying the website to AWS and setting up the cloud infrastructure.
